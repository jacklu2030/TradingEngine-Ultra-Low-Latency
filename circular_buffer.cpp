#include "circular_buffer.h"

/*
 * What LMAX Disruptor boils down to though, is a ring buffer - a fixed-size array which behaves as if it were connected end to end.
 * There is a head and a tail index, items are inserted at the tail and removed at the head, each time advancing the relevant index.
 * When one of the indexes reaches the end of the array, they simply wrap around to 0 again. When the tail catches up with the head,
 * the buffer is full. When the head catches up with the tail, the buffer is empty.
 *
 * What Disruptor actually has is a pair of indexes for the head, and a pair for the tail. When a producer thread wants to insert an item
 * in to the queue, it uses an RMW operation to read the first tail index and then advance it by 1. This allows the producer to "claim"
 * its write index. When it has completed the write, it advances the second tail index. The same goes for reads - first a consumer thread
 * acquires its read index, reads the value, and then advances the second read index.
